Developed an AI voice assistant using the ChatGPT API. Just for practise. 


It requires certain python lib to run.

speech_recognition: for recognizing speech from the microphone input
pyttsx3: for text-to-speech synthesis
openai: for generating text responses using OpenAI's GPT-3 API

pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 openai


Make sure you have the appropriate API keys and permissions for each library, especially for OpenAI's GPT-3 API, which requires an API key to use.
